Hello! I am LegalAI.bd. How can I assist you with your question about Bangladeshi today?



User Ask - What are the steps to file for a divorce in Bangladesh?

AI Response - Okay, so the user is asking about the steps to file for a divorce in Bangladesh. I need to provide a clear, step-by-step explanation based on the context provided. Let me start by recalling the context given.

From the context, I see that there are specific sections related to divorce registration under Muslim Law. Section (1) mentions that a Nikah Registrar can register a divorce if an application is made. Section (2) the application must be oral, by the person who effected the divorce, or by a vakil if the woman is parda-nin. Section () talks about Talaq-i-tafweez needing a registered document.


So the process probably involves approaching the Nikah, making an oral application, providing necessary documents, and possibly waiting for registration or appealing if denied.


I structure the answer for the general public, simple language and. I'll start with a direct answer, then explain the law, the implications, and list the steps. I'll also include a disclaimer.


I need make sure I don't include any information beyond the context. For example, I don't know about other laws like the Family Courts Ordinance, so I focus on what's provided.


So, steps would be: approach the Nikah Registrar, make an oral application, provide documents, registration, and appeal if needed. I'll present these in clear, numbered list with explanations.


‚öñÔ∏è To file for a divorce in Bangladesh, you need to approach the Nikah Registrar, make an oral application, provide necessary documents, and await registration. If refused, can appeal to the Registrar.


üìú The law states that a divorce under Muslim Law must registered by the Nikah Registrar upon oral application by the person effected the divorce. For Talaq-i-tafweez, a registered document delegating divorce power is required.


üîç This means you must personally or through a representative to the Nikah Registrar, ensuring all legal requirements are met, especially for specific types of divorce.


üìå Here are the key steps:



Approach theah Registrar in your jurisdiction.

Make an oral application to register the divorce.

Provide required documents, such as a registered delegation for Talaq-i-tafweez.

If registration is denied file an appeal within 30 days.

ChatGPT Respond with same question - In Bangladesh, the divorce procedure depends on whether it is **under Muslim Family Laws (for Muslims)**, **under the Special Marriage Act**, or **under other personal laws** (for Hindus, Christians, etc.).
Since the majority of divorces in Bangladesh are under **Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961**, I‚Äôll outline that first.

---

## **Divorce Procedure for Muslims in Bangladesh** (Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, 1961)

### **1. Decide on the form of divorce**

* **Talaq by husband** ‚Üí The husband pronounces divorce (oral or written).
* **Khula by wife** ‚Üí The wife requests divorce from the husband, usually returning her *dower (mahr)*.
* **Delegated divorce (Talaq-e-Tafweez)** ‚Üí If the husband has given her the right in the marriage contract.

---

### **2. Send a written notice to the Chairman of the local Union Parishad/Pourashava**

* **Mandatory** under **Section 7 of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance**.
* If in a city area ‚Üí Send to **Ward Commissioner or Mayor‚Äôs office**.
* The notice must state:

  * Names of the spouses
  * Address
  * Date of marriage
  * Reason for divorce
  * Date of pronouncement (if already pronounced)

---

### **3. Chairman forms an Arbitration Council**

* Within a few days of receiving the notice, the Chairman sets up the **Arbitration Council**.
* The goal is **conciliation** (trying to reconcile both parties).

---

### **4. Wait for the 90-day statutory period**

* Even if both agree, the divorce does **not** become final until **90 days** have passed from the date the notice was received by the Chairman.
* If the wife is pregnant ‚Üí Divorce takes effect after **delivery** or 90 days, whichever is later.

---

### **5. Divorce becomes effective**

* After **90 days** (or childbirth), the divorce is legally valid.
* The Chairman issues a **Certificate of Divorce**.

---

### **6. Post-divorce steps**

* **Iddah period** (3 menstrual cycles for women) must be observed before remarriage.
* Division of property, *mahr*, and child custody arrangements follow Islamic and legal provisions.

---

## **Special Notes for Other Religions**

* **Christians** ‚Üí Governed by the Divorce Act, 1869 (must file in Family Court for dissolution).
* **Hindus** ‚Üí No divorce provisions for traditional Hindu marriage in Bangladesh, except for certain special cases like conversion.
* **Special Marriage Act** ‚Üí Civil marriages under this law require a court process for dissolution.

---

‚úÖ **Key Tip:**
For Muslims in Bangladesh, **you cannot just pronounce talaq verbally** and walk away ‚Äî **written notice to the local authority is mandatory**. Otherwise, the divorce is invalid in the eyes of the law, even if religiously valid.

If you want, I can prepare a **step-by-step checklist with exact forms and sample notice format** for filing a divorce in Bangladesh so it‚Äôs legally valid. This would make the process much easier. Would you like me to do that?
