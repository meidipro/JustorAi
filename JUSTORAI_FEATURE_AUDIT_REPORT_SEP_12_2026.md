---

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive review of recent architectural, multi-modal, and user experience upgrades delivered to **JustorAI**. The changes solve core usability and legal accuracy challenges:

1. **Eliminated Statutory Hallucination Risks:** Anchored internal canonical laws (Penal Code, CrPC, CPC, NI Act, Supreme Court precedents) prior to augmenting answers with live real-time government gazettes and web intelligence.
2. **Elevated User Retention & Engagement:** Replaced static, instant text dumps with fluid, word-by-word streaming generation comparable to ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.
3. **Overhauled Mobile Ergonomics:** Reclaimed over 130px of horizontal width on mobile screens, eliminated the obstructive bottom footer navigation, and placed all primary views in an intuitive slide-out drawer.
4. **Structured Information Architecture:** Enforced that all source citations and web references remain **hidden by default**, allowing users to focus on the executive legal advice first and expand underlying authorities on demand.
5. **Integrated Multi-Modal Google Cloud Credits ($2,300 Allocation):** Enabled high-accuracy Bengali/English OCR document scanning, chambers voice dictation, and cross-encoder re-ranking under GCP project **`justorai-508321`**.

## 2. What We Added (New Capabilities)

### A. Two-Tier Legal Synthesis (Statutory RAG + Google Live Grounding)
* **What It Does:** Previously, enabling Google Search caused the platform to overwrite core statutory provisions with raw search results. We built a strict **two-tier synthesis architecture**:
  1. **Tier 1 (Canonical Law):** Internal RAG retrieves and verifies controlling sections from 46,000+ provisions and Supreme Court precedents.
  2. **Tier 2 (Real-Time Web Intelligence):** Queries Google Live Search for recent gazettes, ministerial circulars, and Supreme Court causelists, synthesizing them into a dedicated section beneath the primary legal opinion:
     `### 🌐 Real-Time Gazette & Web Intelligence (Google Live Search)`
* **Sanitized Source Cards:** Vertex AI proxy URLs (`vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com`) are automatically stripped, displaying clean domains (`minlaw.gov.bd`, `supremecourt.gov.bd`, `dpp.gov.bd`) with Google favicons.

### B. Perplexity-Style Collapsible Web Grounding & Statutory Citations
* **What It Does:** Sub-sources are now **collapsed by default** to keep the response card clean and executive.
* **Interactive Summary Bars:**
  * `📚 Sources (N) — Click to show sources ▼` / `তথ্যসূত্র দেখতে ক্লিক করুন ▼`
  * `🌐 Web & Gazette Sources (N) Google Live 🌐 — Click to show sources ▼`
* **Dynamic Indicators:** Expanding the details toggles the prompt to `Click to hide sources ▲` / `তথ্যসূত্র লুকাতে ক্লিক করুন ▲`.
* **Clickable Header Badges:** The top status badges (`📚 N Authorities Cited ▾` and `🌐 Google Live Grounded ▾`) are interactive buttons that toggle open the corresponding source drawer and scroll it into view.

### C. Word-by-Word Streaming Delivery (`streamTextToElement`)
* **What It Does:** Delivers AI responses word-by-word, sentence-by-sentence at a natural reading speed (~60 words/second) accompanied by an animated pulsing vertical cursor (`.streaming-pulse-cursor`).
* **Auto-Scroll Engine:** Intelligently follows output generation without fighting manual user scroll intent if an advocate scrolls up to read a previous passage.

### D. Google Cloud Multi-Modal Intelligence ($2,300 GCP Allocation)
* **Vision Document OCR (`backend/ocr_service.py`):** Ingests multi-page PDFs, deeds, FIRs, and Supreme Court certified judgments in Bengali & English, extracting and summarizing legal controversy into the prompt.
* **Speech-to-Text v2 (`backend/speech_service.py`):** Provides instant voice dictation for lawyers dictating facts or client statements in Bengali (`bn-BD`) or English (`en-US`).
* **Vertex AI Cross-Encoder Re-Ranking (`backend/reranker.py`):** Re-scores retrieved statutory provisions using deep cross-attention, ensuring highest-precedence rulings rank #1.

## 3. What We Changed & Refined

### A. Justor AI Brand Masthead Directly Above Response Bubble
* **Previous Issue:** The AI avatar was an isolated 36x36 floating circular button to the left of the card, creating an awkward margin and confusing desktop/mobile users.
* **What Changed:** Replaced the floating icon with a unified brand header positioned directly above the card:
  `[🔷 Justor Emblem] Justor AI · Legal Intelligence / আইনি এআই সহকারী`
* **Impact:** Confirms AI authorship with 100% clarity and frees up the entire card width below.

### B. Mobile Screen Width & Typography Expansion
* **Previous Issue:** On standard smartphones (360px–400px), the response card was squished into a narrow ~200px column due to multiple layered desktop paddings and avatar margins.
* **What Changed:**
  * Hidden `.assistant-avatar-badge` on mobile.
  * Reduced scroll container padding from `24px 20px` to `10px 8px`.
  * Set `.research-result-layout` to `width: 100% !important; max-width: 100% !important;`.
  * Tuned card interior padding from `28px 32px` to `14px 12px`.
* **Impact:** Reclaimed **130px+ of horizontal width**. The response bubble now occupies **92–95% of mobile screen width** with comfortable, readable line breaks.

### C. Removed Fixed Mobile Bottom Navigation
* **Previous Issue:** A fixed 4-item bottom navigation bar (`Home`, `Bite-Size Learning`, `Ask`, `User Profile`) covered 58px of viewport height, pushed the input composer up, and cluttered the interface.
* **What Changed:**
  * Completely removed the fixed bottom bar (`.mobile-bottom-nav`).
  * Migrated all routes into the top-left slide-out hamburger menu (`☰`), including:
    * 🏠 Home (`/`)
    * ⚖️ Legal Research Home (`/workspace/professional`)
    * 📚 Legal Library (`/legal-library`)
    * 📖 Legal Guides (`/guides`)
    * ⚖️ Case Precedents (`/legal-library?type=case`)
    * 📜 Statutes & Acts (`/legal-library?type=law`)
    * ⏱️ Legal Updates (`/legal-updates`)
    * 👤 User Profile & Settings (`/profile`)
  * Added auto-dismiss upon selecting any destination and an explicit close button (`✕`).
  * Restored sticky composer padding so the input box rests flush against the screen bottom.

### D. Composer In-Box Controls & Auto-Dismiss Toast
* **What Changed:** Integrated the Google Live Search toggle capsule directly inside the input tray alongside the OCR and Voice buttons.
* **Auto-Dismiss Toast:** Turned permanent toast alerts into auto-dismissing notifications (2600ms) with smooth fade animations.
